<p>JavaScripters is an initiative taken for front-end engineers community to share and gain JavaScript basic and advance knowledge along with moto to connect all javascripters together.</p>

<p>We believe in ” Power is gained by sharing knowledge not hoarding it” . It is platform for sharing &amp; gaining knowledge among expertise , intermediate &amp; even the beginners too.</p>

<p>Javascripters community is for exchange/ share the knowledge and views for Front end Engineers. Our goal is to extend wide services to Front end Engineers who want to be expertise in JavaScript / Front end technologies. To start with we are warm welcoming the Engineers from Pune / Mumbai. And after we have plans to enhance our services around the globe.</p>

<p>Now a days front-end engineering keep growing, every day new frameworks and technical approaches has been introduced.</p>

<p>It is very difficult to get hands on experience and knowledge on latest front-end technologies. 
Some time engineers adopted latest technologies but don't know how to implement code by considering best coding practices, and few engineers might have confusion in there mind about some core concepts &amp; it's usage. Off-course all passionate engineers want to clear there technical concepts and interested to become expert/master in this area, so we are here to provide them a big platform for sharing and gaining knowledge.</p>
